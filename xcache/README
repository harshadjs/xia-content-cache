xcache: XIA External cache
--------------------------
This folder contains the implementation of XIA external cache. Click
communicates with xcache over UDP connection on port 1444. Xcache
maintains cache for all 'virtual' network devices running under
click. Source code has been organized into 3 layered structure:

1. xcache-click interface:
   (xcache.c)
   Main entry/exit layer. Handles packets to/from click.

2. xcache controller:
   (xcache_controller.c)
   This layer manages multiple click devices. Whenever a request comes
   from click, this layer identifies corresponding 'cache slice' and
   forwards the request towards it. A Network device is always
   identified by HID.

3. xcache slices:
   (xcache_slices.c)
   All the per client policies/timeouts are handled here.

Folder tests contain some basic test programs that can be used to
verify the functionality of xcache.

TODOs:
1. Implement LRU
2. DENIED packet.
3. What to do if STORE request is received for cache object which is
   already present in the cache?
